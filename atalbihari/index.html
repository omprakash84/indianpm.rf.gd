          <p><strong> #PM !</strong> Sh. Atal Bihari was born on December 25, 1924 in Gwalior. His father Sh. Krishan Bihari Vajpayee was a poet. He got his education at Victoria College (presently known as Luxmi Bai College) in Gwalior. He took his degree in Master of Arts in Political Science from D.A.V. College in Kanpur. He possessed a multi-facet intelligence. The aspect of leadership, speaker and skilled debater are some of the shining qualities in the personality of Sh. A.B. Vajpayee.</p>

            <p>Sh. Atal Bihari Vajpayee openly took part in the struggle for freedom of India. He went to jail in 1942 and after independence during the period 1975 to 1977 under arrest under the police custody.</p>
            
            <p>An able and expert parliamentarian Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee has a long experience of Parliamentary tradition, duties and activities. He was President of several committees from time to time from 1966 onwards of the Rajya Sabha, such as Public Accounts Committee during 1967-70 and 1991-93 and left his stamp of active leadership as President of the permanent committee of foreign affairs.</p>
            
            <p>Sh. Atal Bihari Vajpayee is a strong favourite and supporter of Hindi, our national language. He proved himself as loyal to the Indian Republic. He was the first citizen of India who expressed his thoughts in Hindi in the U.N.O. as an Indian foreign minister first time.</p>
            
            <p>As a founder member of Bhartiya Jan Sangh, Shri Vajpayee guided the Parliamentary Party of Jan Sangh in the Parliament. During the emergency, at the call of Shri Jai Prakash Narayan, Bhartiya Jan Sangh Party merged with Janata Party and in 1977 Shri Morarji Desai became the Prime Minister of India. Shri Atal Ji took the responsibility of Foreign Minister in the Ministry with success. After the bifurcation of Janta Party, Bhartiya Janata Party was founded. Shri Vajpayee became the President of Bhartiya Janata Party from 1980 to 1986. Shri Vajpayee maintained his special position as the leader of Parliamentary Party of BJP and as the opposition leader too.</p>
            
            <p>Literature and journalism are the favourite subjects of Sh. Atal Bihari Vajpayee. According to his faith, he proved his share but free-thinking as an editor of Panchjanya, Rashtra Dharma. Daily Veer Arjun and Daily Swadesh. His famous writings are Kaidi Kavi Ki Kundliyam (collection of speeches), Amar Aag Ha. Meri Ekyavan Kavitayen (collection of poems). Atalji in the Lok Sabha, New Dimensions of Indian Foreign Policy, Jan Sankhya Aur Musalman, Three Decades in Parliament and Four Decades in Parliament (Collection of Speeches in Parliament) etc.</p>
            
            <p>Shri Vajpayee was honoured with “Padam Vibhushan” in 1992 and “Doctor of Philosophy” by Kanpur University in 1993 and Lok Manya Tilak and Pandit Govind Vallabh Pant Awards in 1994 for being the best parliamentarian.
            His Government in 1996 lasted just 13 days, his second term as Prime Minister in 1998 was 13 months. He took oath third time on 13 October 1999. His government achieved grand diplomatic success in mustering international support for India and this resulted in Pakistan being isolated internationally. His commitment to give priority to speed up economic reforms, comprehensive electoral reforms, enact new laws for the financial sector, water, health, housing, education and rural roads are indeed the right pointers of a dedicated and modern Prime Minister who is keen to place India on a different international footing. Indeed India’s progress in the 21 century would be astounding under the able stewardship of Sh. Atal Bihari Vajpayee.</p>

          <p>The game of Snakes & Ladders was created by the 13th century poet saint Gyandev. It was originally called 'Mokshapat'. The ladders in the game represented virtues and the snakes indicated vices. The game was played with cowrie shells and dices. In time, the game underwent several modifications, but its meaning remained the same, i.e. good deeds take people to heaven and evil to a cycle of re-births. </p>
